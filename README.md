# RAG-2.0

# RAG process; This goes through all the basic steps of:

1. Getting data (HTML in my case).
2. Processing data.
3. Creating documents or small chunks in other words.
4. Creating word embeddings and storing them in a vector database (ChromaDB).
5. Retrieveing the data and creating a prompt for model (Chatgpt-3.5).
6. Generating response or answer based on context.
